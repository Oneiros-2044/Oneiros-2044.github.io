#My portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio-page, https://sunnystays.github.io/
##What is this?
This is a website to show-off projects I have made. The home-page is a summary page for me, my experience and my most recent and proudest projects I have worked on.
The site also contains a full projects page with all of my work displayed
##Who can use this?
This website is completely and absolutely open source. That means you can use any part of this website's code and assets in your own!
The sun icon comes from https://humbleicons.com/ and the rest is taken from their respective websites (Github, LinkedIn). All other assets are home-made
