      <p>This is a space for me to put my projects, I collect over the months. Expect this website to change as I add more projects and try to advertise myself more.</p>
      <p>The simple (lack of) styling of this website is intentional. This is simply supposed to be a list of projects for now. No fancy styling needed as long as it's functional.</p>
      <p>If you stumble upon this page and have any questions, you can simply scream into the void of the internet until I set up a proper contact form</p>
